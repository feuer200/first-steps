<h1>My <em>first</em> steps in coding</h1>
<p>Whatever you do<br>should come to the success<br>after enough of efforts.<br> Halleluja</p>

<p>I know, I <strong>can</strong> manage <em>it</em><br>no matter how much time it takes<br> there is always the way to learn something new:</p>
<ul>
<li>stay motivated</li>
<li>stay careful</li>
<li>stay focused</li></ul>
<p>in case you are confused one day, just remember:</p>
<ol>
<li>never give up</li>
<li>never be affraid</li>
<li>never despare</li>
</ol>
<p> <strong><em>everything</em></strong> will be great</p>
<h3>just go and do</h3>
<p>let us take the next step, which could be not that easy,<br> but you learn during an hour<br> much more, then you learned before in years.</p>

<ul>
<li>how to make the heads, also with subheads</li>
<li>how to write in emphasise</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>how to make unordered and ordered lists</li>
<li>how to put the pictures on your page</li>
